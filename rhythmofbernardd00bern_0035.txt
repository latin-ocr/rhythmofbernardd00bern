Thine ageless walls are bonded
With amethyst unpriced :
Thy Saints build up its fabric,
And the corner-stone is CHRIST.
The Cross is all thy splendonr,
The Crucified thy praise:
His laud and benedietion
Thy ransomecl people raise:
J EsUS‚ the Gem of Beauty‚
True ,GoD and Man, they sing:
The never-failing Garden‚
The ever-golden Ring:

The Door, the Pledge‚ the Husband,

The Guardian of His Court:
The Day-star of Salvati0n‚

The Porter and the Port.
Thou hast no shore, fair ocean!

Thou hast no time, bright day!
Dear fountain of refreshment
To pilgrims far away!
