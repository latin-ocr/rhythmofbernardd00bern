 

Prcfface to the Third Edition.

In this Third Edition, a few verses have been a
little pohshed, and one or two phrases brought
nearer to the original. I am deeply thankful that
Bernard's lines seem to have spoken to the hearts
of so many: I ean reekon up at least fourteen
new Hymnals in which more or fewer of them
have found a place.

the best known, and with children the most popular 3 ἰ

(no small proof, in my estimation‚ of the goodness of ¹
Church-music :)-that of my friend, the Rev. H. L.

J enner, perhaps the most ecelesiastica] 3—and that
of another friend, Mr. Edmund seddino· which, to ἶ

my mind, best expresses the meaning Oe} the words.
