PREFACE ΤΟ THE FIRST EDITION.

 

IN the xii. century, the Abbey of Cluny, under
ἱ its celebrated head, Peter the Vene1·able,---(he held
that dignity from 1122 to 1156,)—-was at the very
height of monastic reputation. Its glorious church,
the most magnificent in France, the fulness and
exactness of its ritual, and the multitude of its
brethren, raised it to a pitch of fame which, perhaps,
no other house ever attained.

At that time, one of its children was Bernard, born
at Morlaix, in Bretagne3 but of English parents.
He occupied a portion of his leisure by the com-
position of a poem, De Contempta Mundi, in about
three thousand lines. The greater part is a bitter
satire on the fearful corruptions of the age ; and hence
it was for the first time edited by Flacius Illyricus,
the red-hot Reformer, in his ‘⁴ Varia poemata de
Corrupto Ecclesiae Statu,” Basle, 1556. It has
been reprinted, at least six times: by Chytraeus, at
Bremen, 15973 at Rostock, 16103 at Leipsic, 16263
by Lubinus, at Lunenburg, 1640 3 in Wachler’s
New Theological Annals, December, 18203 and
