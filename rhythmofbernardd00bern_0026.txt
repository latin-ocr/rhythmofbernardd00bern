That fulness and that craving
Alike are free from pain,

Where thou, midst heavenly citizens,
A home like theirs shall gain.

Here is the warlike trumpet3
There, life set free from sin 3

When to the last Great Supper
The faithful shall come in:
When the heavenly net is laden
With fishes many and great 3
So glorious in its fulness‚
Yet so inviolate:
And the perfect from the sliatteied,
And the fall'n from them that stand,
And the sheep-floek from the goat-hercl
shall part on either hand ε
And these shall pass to torment‚
And those shall pass to rest ;
The new peculim· nation,
The fulness of the Blest.
