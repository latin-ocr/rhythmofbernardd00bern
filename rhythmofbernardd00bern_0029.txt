The life that knows no ending,
The tearless life, is There.

O happy retribution !
Short toil, eternal rest 3

For mortals and for sinners
A mansion with the blest!

That we should look, poor wand'rers,
To have our home on high!

That worms should seek for dwellings
Beyond the starry sky 1

To all one happy guerdon
Of one celestial grace ;

For all, for all, who mourn their fall,
Is one eternal place:

And martyrdom hath roses
Upon that heavenly ground :

And white and virgin lilies
For virgin-souls abound.
There grief is turned to pleasure ·
Such pleasure, as below
