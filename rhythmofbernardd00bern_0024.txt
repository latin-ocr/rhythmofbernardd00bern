 

 

The peace of all the faithful,
The calm of all the blest,
Inviolate‚ unvaried,
Divinest, sweetest‚ best.
Yes, peace! for war is needlessfa
Yes, calm! for storm is past,—
And goal from finished labour,
And anchorage at last.
That peace—but who may claim it?
The guileless in their way,
Who keep the ranks of battle,
Who mean the thing they say:
The peace that is for heaven,
And shall be too for earth:
The palace that re-echos
With festal song and mirth;
The garden, breathing spices,
The paradise Qn l1igh3

Grace beautified to glory, ἱ
Unceasing minstrelsy.
