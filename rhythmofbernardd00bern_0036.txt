Upon the Roek of Ages
They raise thy holy tower:
Thine is the vietor’s laurel,
And thine the golden dower ε
Thou feel’st in mystie raptum,

O Bride that know’st no guile,

The Prince's sweetest kisses,
The Prince's loveliest smile t
Unfading lilies, braeelets
Of living pearl‚ thine own3
The LAMB is ever near thee,
The Bridegroom thine alone:
The Crown is He to guerdon,
The Buckler to protect,
And He Himself the Mansion,
And He the Architect. Β

The only art thou needest,
Thanksgiving for thy lot:

· The only joy thou seekest,

The Life where Death is not:
