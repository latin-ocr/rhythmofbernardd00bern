When the just and gentle Monarch
Shall summon from the tomb,
Let man, the guilty, tremble,
For Man, the Gon, shall doom.
Arise, alise, good Christian,
Let right to wrong succeed3
Let penitential sorrow
Το heavenly gladness lead 3
To the light that hath no evening?
That knows nor moon nor sun,
The light so new and golden‚
The light that is but one.
And when the Sole-Begotten
Shall render up once more
The kingdom to the FATHER
Whose own it was before,—

ἓ Compare a beautiful hymn on the Theban

Legion, which says:

Dies sine vespera, nocte non sepultus:
Quem non sol per aera, sed divini vultus
Illustrat serenitas3 tali fato fultus,

Quo senes sunt juvenes 3 nemo fit adultus.
