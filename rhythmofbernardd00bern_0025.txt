There nothing can be feeble‚

There none can ever mourn,
There nothing is divided,

There nothing ean be torn :
'Tis fury, ill, and scandal,

’Tis peaoeless peace beloxv3
Peaee, endless, strifeless, ageless,
. The halis of Syon know.

Ο happy, holy portion,

Refection for the blest 3
True vision of true beauty,

Sweet eure of all distrest!
Sti-ive, man, to win that glory3

Toil, man, to gain that light3
Send hope before to grasp it,

Till hope be lost in sight τ
Till J ESUS gives the portion

Those blessed souls to fill ,
The insatiam, yet satisfied‚

The full, yet craving still.
