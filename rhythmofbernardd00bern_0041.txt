Identify, unite.
Thou City of the Angels !
Thou City of the Lonn !
'Whose everlasting music
Is the glorious deoaehord l*
And there the band of Prophets
United praisev ascribes,
And there the twelvefold chorus
Of Israel's ransomed tribes ε
The lily-beds of virgins,
The roses' martyr-glow,
The eohort of the Fathers
Who kept the saith below.

And there the Sole-Begotten
Is LORD in regal state3

stands the ‘⁴ instrument of ten st1·ings'' of the perfect harmony
of heaven.
