He, J udah’s mystie Liou,
He, Lamb Immaculate.

Ο fields that know no sorrow!
Ο state that fears no strife!

O princely bow'rs ! O land of flow’rs!
O Realm and Home of Life!

 

Jerusalem ,’ ex ulting v ¹ i
On that seem-est shore,

I hope thee, wish thee, sing thee, 1
And love thee evermore! ι

Ι ask not for„ my merit: Ι ,²

I seek not to deny Ῐ.

My merit is destruction, 7

A child of wrath am I:

But yet with Paith I venture -

And Hope upon my way ;

For those perennial guel-dous

I labour night and day.
