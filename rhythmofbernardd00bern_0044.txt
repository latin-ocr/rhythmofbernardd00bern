Shall I ever win thy grace?

To comfort and to bless Σ

Shall I ever win the prize itself 2

Exust, O (lust and ashes!

The LoRD shall be thy part ε
His only, His fol· ever,

Thou shalt be, and thou art 2
Exult, O (lust and ashes l

The LORD shall be thy part :

His only, His for ever,
Thou shalt be, and thou art !
