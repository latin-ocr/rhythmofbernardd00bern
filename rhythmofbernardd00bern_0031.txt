The bland and fiattering struggles
Of the flesh shall pass away :
And none shall there be jealous3

And none shall there contend ε
F raud, clamour, guile—what say 1?

—All ill, all ill shall end!
And there is David's Fountain‚
And life in fullest glow‚
And there the light is golden,
And milk and honey fiow :
The light that hath no eveniug,
The health that hath no sore,
The life that hath no ending,
But lasteth evermore.

There J Esus shall embrace us,
There J ESUS be embraced,—

That spirit's foocl and sunshine
VVhence meaner love is chas'd.
