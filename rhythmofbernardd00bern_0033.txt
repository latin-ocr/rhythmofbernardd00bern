And every ear shall hear it 3-—

Behold thy King's array 3
Behold thy Gon in beauty3

The Law hath past away!

Yes Σ Gon my King and Portion,

In fulness of His grace,
We then shall see for ever,
And worship face to face.
Then Jacob into Israel,
From earthlier self estranged,
And Leah into Rahel
> For ever shall be changed ε
Then all the halls of Syon
For aye shall be complete;
And, in the Land of Beauty‚
All things of beauty meet.
