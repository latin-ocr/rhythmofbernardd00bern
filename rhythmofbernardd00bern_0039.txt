Yet evermore content!

O true, peculiar vision
Of Gon cunctipotent !

Ye know the many mansions
For many a glorious name,

And divers retributione
That divers merits claim :

For midst the constellatione
That deck our earthly sky,

The glory of the Elect!
O deal· and future vision
That eager hearts expect:
Even now by faith I See thee:
Even here thy walls diseern:
