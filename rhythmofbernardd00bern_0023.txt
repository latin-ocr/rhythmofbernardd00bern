Then glory yet unheard of
Shall shed abroad its ray,

Resolving all enigmas,
An endless Sabbath-day.
Then, then from his oppressore

The Hebrew shall go free,

And celebrate in triumph
The year of J ubilee3

And the sunlit Land that reeks not
Of tempest nor of fight,

Shall sold within its bosom

Each happy Israelite:
The Home of fadeless splendonr,

Of flowers that fear no thorn,

Where they shall dwell as children,

Who here as exiles mourn.
Midst power that knows no limit,
And wisdom free from bound,

The Beatifie Vision
Shall glad the Saints around:
