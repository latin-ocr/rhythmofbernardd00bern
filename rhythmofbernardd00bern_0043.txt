The Best and Dearest FATHER
Who made me and Who saved,

Bore with me in defilement,
And from defilement laved ε

When in His strength I struggle,
For very joy I leap3

When in my sin I totter,
I weep, or try to weep z

And grace, sweet grace-celestial,
Shall all its love display,

And David’sl Royal Fountain
Purge everysin away.

O mine, my golden Syon 1
Ο lovelier far than gold !
With laurel-girt battalions,
And safe victorious fold z
O sweet. and blessed Country,
Shall I ever see thy face?
