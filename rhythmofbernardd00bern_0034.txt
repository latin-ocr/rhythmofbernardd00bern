For thee, O dear dear Country!
Mine eyes their vigils keep 3
For very love, beholding
Thy happy name, they weep ·.
The mention of thy glory
Is unction to the breast,
And medicine in siekness,
And love, and life, and rest.
O one, O onely Mansion!
O Paradise of J oy Ξ
'Where tears are ever banished,
And smiles have no alloy;
Beside thy living waters
All plants are, great and small,
The cedar of the forest,
The hyssop of the wall z
With jaspers glow thy bulwarks ;

Thy streets with emeralds blaze3

. The sardius and the topaz
Unite in thee their rays ε
