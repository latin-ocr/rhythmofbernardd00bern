- Jerusalem demands them:

They paid the price on earth,

And now shall reap the harvest
In blissfulness and mirth:

The glorious holy people,
Who evermore relied

Upon their Chief and Father7
The King, the Crucified:

The sacred ransomed number
Now bright with endless sheen,

Who made the Cross their watchworsi
Of J Esus Nazarene:

Who, fed with heavenly nectar,

Where seul-like odours play,

Draw out the endless leisure
Of that long vernal day :

While through the sacred lilies,
And flowers on every side,

The happy dear-bought nations
Go wandering far and wide.
