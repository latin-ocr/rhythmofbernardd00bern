Their breasts are filled with gladness,
Their mouths are tun'd to praise,
What time, now safe for ever,
On former sins they gaze ε

The fouler was the error,
The sadder was the fall,
The ampler are the praises

Of Him Who pardoned all.
Their one and only anthem‚
The fulness of His love,
Who gives, instead. of torment,
Eternal joys above:
Instead of torment, glory 3
Instead of death, that life
Wherewith your happy Country,
True Israelites! is rife.

Bri‹·f life is here our portion3
Brief sorrow, short-liv'd care3
