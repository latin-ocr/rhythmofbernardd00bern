To thee my thoughts are kindled,
And strive and pant and yearn :
Jerusalem the onely,
That look’st from heaven below,
In thee is all my glory3
In me is all my woe ;
And though my body may not,
My spirit seeks thee fain,
Till fiesh and earth return me
To earth and fiesh again.
O none ean tell thy bulwarks,
How gloriously they rise ε
Ο none can tell thy capitals
Of beautiful device:

Thy loveliness oppresses

All human thought and heart: ,

And. none, O peace, O Syon,
Can sing thee as thou art.

New mansion of new people‚
Whom Gon's own love and light
