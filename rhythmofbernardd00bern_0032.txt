Amidst the happy chorus,
A place, however low,

Shall shew Him us3 and shewing‚ 2

Shall satiate evermo.
By hope we struggle onward,
While here we must be fed
With milk, as tender instmts,
But there with Living Bread.
The night was full of terror,

The morn is bright with gladness ε

The Cross becomes our harbour,
And we triumph after sadness :
And J EsUs to His true ones

Brings trophies fair to see:

And J EsUs shall be loved, 33
Beheld in Galilee.

Beheld, when morn shall waken,
And shadows shall decay,

, And each true-hearted servant

shall shine as· doth the day ε
